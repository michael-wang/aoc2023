I use [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as an exercise of programming.
This year I start with Golang, and maybe Dart as next.

To make things simpler, I decided to make all code stay in same package, so some naming rules are needed:
- Start with dXX_ where XX is the day, followed by capital char, e.g. `d01_Part1()`.
